### Hi there,

I'm Razvan, a diligent and highly creative computer science student who currently completes Bachelor in Computer Science with specific focus on Affective Computing. My main field of interest is Artificial Intelligence, but I enjoy Software Engineering and general Computer Science too. Beside computer science, I like emotional intelligence, literature and health.
