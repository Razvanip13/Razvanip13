### About me:
I'm Razvan, a diligent and highly creative computer science student.<br/> <br/>
Currently I'm a Research Trainee at LISN Institute in Paris. <br/>
I had a 6 months research scholarship where I developed speech to text models for Romanian medics. The research was taking part in my university and it was funded by PixelData. <br/>
I was a full-stack intern at TSS Yonder on .Net and Vue.js.<br/>
I graduated Computer Science at Babeș-Bolyai University <br/>
I'm learning Artificial Intelligence because I've always been fascinated about systems that can learn by themselves. You can find some of my projects on my profile.
